get-simulator is the simulation tool of the `GET <http://bitbucket.org/get/>`_ suite of tools for standards-based epithelial transport modelling. This simulation tool is being developed to work with `SED-ML <http://sed-ml.org>`_ documents describing the simulation experiments to execute, and currently only works with models encoded in `CellML <http://cellml.org>`_. See the `GET documentation <http://get-documentation.readthedocs.org/>`_ for all the details. NOTE: currently most work is occuring on the ``using-cellml`` branch.
